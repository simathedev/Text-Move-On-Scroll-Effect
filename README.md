# Text Move On Scroll Effect
Welcome to my Text Move On Scroll Effect project! This is one of my early experiments with web development tools and technologies, and it showcases the fascinating combination of Next.js, GSAP, and Framer Motio
## Project Overview
The Text Move On Scroll Effect is a visually engaging experience where the direction of text movement changes as you scroll up or down. Using Next.js, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and Framer Motion, I've created a dynamic and interactive web page that responds to your scrolling actions.

## Tools And Technologies:
* Nextjs
* GSAP
* Framer-Motion
